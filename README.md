# Regex Filter for Inappropriate Words

This repository contains a regex pattern designed to filter out inappropriate words and phrases in multiple languages, including Russian, Ukrainian and English. The regex is particularly useful for applications that require text moderation, such as chat applications, forums, and user-generated content platforms.

# Features
Multilingual Support: The regex pattern supports both Russian and English languages, allowing for a wide range of inappropriate words to be detected.
Flexible Matching: It allows for variations in character usage, such as special characters and spacing, to bypass simple filters.
Case Insensitivity: The pattern is case-insensitive, making it effective regardless of how words are capitalized.
